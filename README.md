# Hi 👋🏻, I'm Medhat

With a passion for mobile and web development, I've spent the last 5 years crafting seamless experiences across platforms. I'm that dev who gets excited about clean architecture and can't stop talking about React Native optimizations. When I'm not wrestling with native modules or fine-tuning app performance, you'll find me exploring new ways to make apps faster and more reliable. I believe in writing code that's not just functional, but maintainable—because let's face it, future me will thank present me for those detailed comments and type definitions.

## 🚀 What Keeps Me Up at Night (In a Good Way)

- 🏗 **Clean Architecture & Systems Design** — Because spaghetti belongs on a plate, not in code  
- 📱 **iOS & Android Development** — Loving both worlds, one platform at a time  
- 🤖 **AI Integrations** — Let’s make apps *smarter*, not just *prettier*  
- 🌐 **Web3 & Decentralized Apps** — Because the future is trustless and unstoppable  
- 🛠 **Creative Problem-Solving** — No challenge is too big when you’re willing to hack around it  

## 💡 What I'm Currently Exploring  

- ⚡ **Building rock-solid mobile architectures**—because a good foundation makes everything easier  
- 🏎 **Pushing app performance to the next level**—shaving off milliseconds wherever I can  
- 🔗 **Diving into crypto & decentralized tech**—because ownership matters  
- 🔥 **Experimenting with AI-powered mobile experiences**—the future is *adaptive*  
- 🧠 **Turning daily challenges into creative solutions**—because why not?
